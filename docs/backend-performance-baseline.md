# Execution backend performance baseline

This document records local reference measurements for JIT/AOT backend work. They are regression
evidence from one machine, not portable pass/fail limits. CI publishes the same benchmark output
for every native RID without failing a build on timing variance.

## M0 Windows x64 baseline

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Commit base: `main@dc38dd2` plus the M0 benchmark corpus
- Configuration: Release, `iterations=1,000,000`
- Runtime: .NET 10.0.3
- OS: Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 10.0.26100, x64
- CPU: Intel Core i7-12700H, 14 cores / 20 logical processors
- Visible memory: approximately 15.7 GiB

| Scenario | Operations | ns/op | Allocated/op |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `table_integer_get_set` | 1,000,000 | 115.00 | 0.04 B |
| `interpreter_empty_numeric_for` | 10 | 4,461,710 | 5,788 B |
| `interpreter_arithmetic_numeric_for` | 10 | 11,158,830 | 5,980 B |
| `interpreter_cold_compile_execute_arithmetic` | 10 | 4,082,000 | 37,012 B |
| `interpreter_warm_arithmetic_numeric_for` | 10 | 3,649,020 | 1,588 B |
| `interpreter_warm_lua_call_vararg_multireturn` | 10 | 4,901,530 | 978,337.60 B |
| `interpreter_warm_table_array_hash` | 10 | 12,120,690 | 271,360.80 B |
| `interpreter_warm_metamethod` | 10 | 5,444,960 | 740,572 B |
| `interpreter_coroutine_yield_resume` | 10 | 25,050 | 4,252 B |
| `interpreter_warm_debug_count_hook` | 10 | 1,997,410 | 245,188 B |
| `interpreter_every_allocation_gc_stress` | 10 | 2,460,060 | 285,588 B |
| `full_gc_1000_tables` | 10 | 263,360 | 164,772 B |

The benchmark performs a short warmup, but it is intentionally a compact regression runner rather
than a statistical microbenchmark framework. Before a backend becomes the default, release
evidence must include repeated cold-start, warm-throughput, compilation latency, peak-memory, and
artifact-size measurements under controlled conditions.

Run locally with:

```powershell
dotnet run --project benchmarks/Lunil.Runtime.Benchmarks/Lunil.Runtime.Benchmarks.csproj `
  --configuration Release -- 1000000
```

## M1 execution-kernel allocation check

The same machine and command were used after introducing the shared execution kernel, Runtime
ABI v1, stack-window calls, and inline operation arguments. Representative allocation changes:

| Scenario | M0 allocated/op | M1 allocated/op | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Lua call + vararg + multiple return | 978,337.60 B | 690,376 B | -29.4% |
| Metamethod loop | 740,572 B | 516,412 B | -30.3% |
| Debug count-hook loop | 245,188 B | 178,588 B | -27.2% |

The new fixed-argument Lua-call scenario measured 514,376 B per 2,000-call execution. It no
longer creates a parameter array for each direct Lua-to-Lua call; the remaining approximately
257 B/call is primarily the current logical frame, continuation, and close-list representation.
Vararg frames retain a persistent vararg window by design. Later frame pooling is a separate
optimization and is not required to preserve the Runtime ABI v1 contract.

## M6 experimental loop OSR check

The M6 corpus adds a 20,000-iteration integer Fibonacci/bitwise while-loop and runs both the
reference interpreter and loop OSR after a short warmup. On the same Windows x64 machine, three
Release runs with `iterations=1,000,000` produced the following median values:

| Scenario | Operations | Median ns/op | Allocated/op |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `interpreter_warm_loop_osr_candidate` | 10 | 30,914,650 | 1,844 B |
| `jit_experimental_loop_osr_candidate` | 10 | 16,235,000 | 9,702.40 B |

The local steady-state throughput improvement is approximately 47.5%, above the 10% M6 benefit
threshold. OSR nevertheless remains an explicit experimental switch and stays disabled by
default: the compact runner is not cross-platform statistical evidence, one of the three process
runs showed substantial startup variance, and the current OSR path allocates about 5.3 times as
much per execution. CI records both scenarios on every native RID so a later milestone can decide
whether broader throughput and allocation evidence justify enabling it in the default policy.
